# Heart Disease Prediction 🫀

This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict whether a patient is at risk of a heart attack based on health-related attributes.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source:** [UCI Heart Disease Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease)
- The dataset contains various health parameters like age, cholesterol levels, resting blood pressure, etc.

## 💻 Technologies Used
- **Language:** Python
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn

## 🛠️ Project Tasks

### 1. Data Analysis
- Imported the dataset.
- Explored dataset statistics (mean, min, max, quartiles).
- Analyzed correlations between features.

### 2. Data Visualization
- Visualized the number of patients with and without heart disease.
- Analyzed age vs heart disease occurrence.
- Plotted a heatmap showing feature correlations.

### 3. Model Building
- **Logistic Regression**
  - Split data (70% train, 30% test).
  - Trained and evaluated the model.
  - Generated confusion matrix and calculated accuracy.

- **Decision Tree**
  - Built and evaluated a Decision Tree model.
  - Visualized the tree using Graphviz.

- **Random Forest**
  - Built and evaluated a Random Forest classifier.
  - Visualized feature importance.

### 4. Model Evaluation
- Compared Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models.
- Calculated and compared:
  - Accuracy
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Precision, Recall, F1 Score
- Visualized confusion matrices using heatmaps.
- Selected the best model based on overall performance.

## 📈 Results
- The project identifies the best-performing model for heart disease prediction.
- It provides detailed evaluation metrics to support the selection.

## 🏥 Domain
